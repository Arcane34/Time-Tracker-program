# Time Tracker

This is a small project that was designed to keep track of time spent doing work then assign a point per 
100 minutes of work which would then be usable for spending when doing other activities like playing sports, games and socialising.

Furthermore, there is a visual representation of the amount of points as particles moving about in the UI,
where red particles represent a 60 minutes and white particles represent 1 minute.

The bottom-left button is the stopwatch that tracks the amount of time spent doing work,
the bottom-right button is the stopwatch that will then track the amount of time spent doing other activities,
the number at the centre represents the current amount of point stored.
