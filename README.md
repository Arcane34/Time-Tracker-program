# Time Tracker

This is a small project that was designed to keep track of time spent doing work then assign a point per 
100 minutes of work which would then be usable for spending when doing other activities like playing sports, games and socialising.
Furthermore, there is a visual representation of the amount of points as particles moving about in the UI,
where red particles represent a 100 minutes and white particles represent 1 point.
